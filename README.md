# Metrohenge (Observable Framework + DuckDB)

Looking at when the sun shines directly down DC Metro escalator using Observable Framework and DuckDB-WASM.

Try it now: https://github.com/jonahweissman/metrohenge

## Overview
- Static site built with Observable Framework
- Client-side DuckDB (duckdb-wasm) to query data in the browser
- OpenStreetMap data for DC Metro escalators

## Next steps

1. Using Microsoft building heights data (https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints) to filter out alignment events that are blocked by buildings.
2. Being a good citizen and adding the missing escalator ways to OSM
